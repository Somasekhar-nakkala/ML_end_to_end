Steps in Data Science Project are as follows
Step 1: Define the Problem
Step 2: Collect the raw data needed for the business problem.
Step 3: Cleaning the data, Exploratory data analysis, Feature Engineering and Feature Selection.
Step 4: Build the models and predict the results.

Step 7: Retrain the model.

Every time when there is some updates in the unseen data or you get some more new features or some new information or if you feel that there is still scope for improvement of your model and thus the predictions, you can retrain your model.
